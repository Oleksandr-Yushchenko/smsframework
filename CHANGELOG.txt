Changes to SMS Framework core module (sms) 6.x-1.x-dev

- Added constants for Message direction codes, Message status codes, Gateway response codes.
- Added sms_receipt() function.
- Modified sms_send()
    - Now passes $gateway and $options to the sms_handle_result().
- Modified sms_handle_result()
    - Added $gateway and $options to @params, with default values.
    - Logging failed messages is now optional, as per admin setting, enabled by default.
    - Will now return a full response array if admin setting is enabled, or the usual TRUE/FALSE - disabled by default. Response array includes message info, gateway array, status values from the gateway and the associated SMS Framework gateway status code.
    - @todo Change ^^ to be an $options key instead of admin setting.
- Moved admin settings functions to include file: sms.admin.inc
- Added include file: sms.countrycode.inc
- Made sms_send_form use the country code list function from sms.countrycode.inc
- Added hook_sms_send_process(). Hook name chosen to preserve backward-compatibility, since hook_sms_send() does not implement the standard $op values ('pre process', 'process', 'post process').

TODO
- Admin setting for sms_log_failed_messages
- What is sms_format_number() for?
- What is sms_validate_number() for?
- sms_formatter() shouldnt be used as a validator function.
- In sms_send(), remove loop in favour of module_invoke_all()
- What if the gateway always returns a message id code? We should be able to capture this.
